# readme.md

This repo is only to set commits that have since been removed, or add ones in place of holidays etc (I'm holding myself accountable)

```bash
set GIT_COMMITTER_DATE='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
set GIT_AUTHOR_DATE='YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
git commit -m "message" --date="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" --amend --no-edit
```

Revert to normal:

```bash
set GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=
set GIT_AUTHOR_DATE=
```
